# Git Remote URL Explained

## What is a Remote URL?

A **remote URL** is the web address that connects your local project to an online repository (like GitHub). It tells Git where to send your code when you upload it.

## Your Remote URL Format

For your HostPilotPro project, the remote URL should be:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

## Examples:
- If your GitHub username is `Hostpilotpro` and repository is `HostPilotPro`:
  ```
  https://github.com/Hostpilotpro/HostPilotPro.git
  ```

- If your GitHub username is `johnsmith` and repository is `hostpilotpro`:
  ```
  https://github.com/johnsmith/hostpilotpro.git
  ```

## How to Find Your Correct Remote URL

1. **Go to your GitHub repository page**
2. **Click the green "Code" button**
3. **Copy the HTTPS URL shown** (it ends with `.git`)

## Common Issues:
- **Case sensitivity matters** - `HostPilotPro` is different from `hostpilotpro`
- **Username must match exactly** - check your GitHub profile
- **Repository name must match exactly** - check the repository title

## Alternative: Use GitHub Web Upload
If the remote URL keeps giving errors, you can upload your files directly through the GitHub website instead of using Git commands.
