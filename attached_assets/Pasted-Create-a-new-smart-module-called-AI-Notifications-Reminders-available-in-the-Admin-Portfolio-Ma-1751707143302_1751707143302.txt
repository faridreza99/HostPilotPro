Create a new smart module called “AI Notifications & Reminders” available in the Admin, Portfolio Manager, and Owner dashboards — per property.

🔹 Location:
- Inside the Property Dashboard (right side panel or separate tab)
- Title: “AI Notifications & Reminders 🧠”

🔹 Purpose:
Automatically scan property data like service intervals, bills, and maintenance history to trigger alerts and planning suggestions.

🔹 Components:

1. Smart Alerts Timeline:
   - Display area for:
     - “Next Pest Control Due: Estimated 18 July 2025”
     - “Electricity Bill from PEA not uploaded yet (due on 17th)”
     - “Pool cleaning overdue – last done 10 days ago”
     - “Last major AC clean was 13 months ago – AI recommends a new service”

2. Trigger Points:
   - AI reads date gaps from:
     - Service logs
     - Uploaded bills
     - Maintenance timeline
   - Sends notifications if:
     - A task is overdue
     - A recurring task is about to be due
     - A bill is expected based on past arrival dates (e.g., always on 15–17th monthly)

3. Notification Visibility:
   - Admin/Manager: Can see all alerts, override or mark as complete
   - Owner: Can view alerts for their own villa(s), cannot delete
   - Staff: Only relevant alerts (e.g., "Today’s scheduled garden task")

4. Alert Types (icons and color-coded):
   - 🧹 Cleaning (standard vs deep)
   - 💡 Electricity bills
   - 🌱 Garden services
   - 🦟 Pest control
   - 🔧 Maintenance
   - ❄️ AC service
   - 💧 Water bills
   - 📅 Upcoming check-in/reminder
   - 🛠 Suggested upgrades (linked to Goals module)

5. AI Action Buttons:
   - "Mark as Done"
   - "Create Task" (Pre-fills task form)
   - "Dismiss Reminder"
   - "Snooze for X days"

6. Future Extension Ready:
   - Once synced with Hostaway + OCR/Receipt uploader, connect actual bills
   - Add push notifications to WhatsApp or staff dashboards

7. Include Demo:
   - Demo Property Aruna:
     - Alert: Pest control overdue (Last 31 May)
     - Alert: Electric bill expected (17 July)
     - Alert: Pool cleaning missed last week
