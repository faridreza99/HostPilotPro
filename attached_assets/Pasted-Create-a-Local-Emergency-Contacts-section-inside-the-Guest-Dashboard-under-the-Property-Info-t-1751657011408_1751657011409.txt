Purpose:  
Give guests easy access to essential contact information and service providers during their stay, grouped by category, and fully editable from Admin/Manager settings per property.

Display Format:
Use clean, collapsible contact cards or a sectioned list with icons and action buttons (Call, WhatsApp, View Menu, etc.).
