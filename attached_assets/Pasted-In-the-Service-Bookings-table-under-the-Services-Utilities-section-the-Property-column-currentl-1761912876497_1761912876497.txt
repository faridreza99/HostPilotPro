In the Service Bookings table under the “Services & Utilities” section, the Property column currently shows “Property 6” (the ID or label from property_id) instead of the actual property name (e.g. “Well Park Residence”).

Expected Behavior:
The column should display the property’s name (from the related Property model or table).

⚙️ Technical Diagnosis

The frontend table is likely binding something like:

booking.property || booking.property_id


which results in “Property 6” because it’s showing the numeric/string ID.

The backend API endpoint (something like /api/service-bookings or /api/bookings/services) probably returns:

{
  "id": "BK-20251031-1267",
  "property_id": 6,
  ...
}


without including the related property name.

🔧 Fix Plan
🩵 STEP 1: Backend (Primary Fix)

Ensure that the property name is included in the API response.

If the backend is Node.js + Express + Prisma/Sequelize/ORM:

Open the controller or route handler for service bookings (likely in:

/server/controllers/serviceBookingController.js

/server/routes/serviceBookings.js

/api/controllers/ServiceBookingsController.ts)

Find where service bookings are fetched, something like:

const bookings = await ServiceBooking.findAll();


or

const bookings = await prisma.serviceBooking.findMany();


✅ Modify it to include property relation:

Sequelize Example:

const bookings = await ServiceBooking.findAll({
  include: [{ model: Property, as: 'property', attributes: ['id', 'name'] }],
});


Prisma Example:

const bookings = await prisma.serviceBooking.findMany({
  include: {
    property: {
      select: { id: true, name: true },
    },
  },
});


Mongo Example (Mongoose):

const bookings = await ServiceBooking.find().populate('property', 'name');


Then return that result as JSON.
So the API now sends:

{
  "id": "BK-20251031-1267",
  "property": { "id": 6, "name": "Well Park Residence" },
  ...
}

🩵 STEP 2: Frontend Update

Open the file responsible for rendering the Service Bookings table.
Likely file path:

/client/src/pages/ServiceBookings.jsx


or

/client/src/components/ServiceBookingsTable.tsx


Find the part where the property column is rendered, something like:

<td>{booking.property}</td>


or

<td>{`Property ${booking.property_id}`}</td>


✅ Change it to use the nested name if available:

<td>{booking.property?.name || booking.property_name || booking.property_id}</td>


This ensures:

Shows the property name if available from backend.

Falls back to property_id only if the name isn’t returned.

🩵 STEP 3: Verify

Rebuild/restart the backend.

Refresh the frontend page (/services/bookings).

Inspect the Network tab → /api/service-bookings response → confirm property.name appears.

Check the Property column now shows “Well Park Residence” (or the actual property name).
