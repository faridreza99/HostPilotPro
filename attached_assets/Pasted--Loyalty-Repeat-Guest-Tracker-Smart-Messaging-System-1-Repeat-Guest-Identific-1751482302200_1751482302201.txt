3. **Smart Messaging (AI Companion):**

💬 Auto-Triggers:
- After check-in → “Welcome message”
- Day before check-out → “Let us know if you need a taxi”
- After check-out → “Thank you + Review Request”
- 3 months after stay → “Come back soon” (discount optional)

AI reads booking reviews:
- Detects if guest says things like "no hot water", “pool dirty”, “loved the breakfast”
- 🧠 Flags the team or generates a recommendation (e.g., create pool task, notify chef manager)

4. **Smart Reply Suggestions (Internal Staff View):**
- Staff gets chat suggestions like:
   - “Hi! Yes we can arrange that for you, let me check availability.”
   - “So sorry for the inconvenience, I will notify our technician right away.”

These reply options appear in the guest chat box as suggested one-click responses.
