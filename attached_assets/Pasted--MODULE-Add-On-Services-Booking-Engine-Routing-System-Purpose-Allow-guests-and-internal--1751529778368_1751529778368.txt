### MODULE: Add-On Services Booking Engine & Routing System

Purpose:
Allow guests (and internal staff) to book extra services (massages, chefs, transport, etc.), while routing the expense to the correct payer: guest, owner, company, or complimentary.

Core Features:

• **Guest-Facing Booking Menu**:
  - Accessible via Guest Dashboard
  - Categories: Cleaning, Laundry, Massages, Chef, Taxi, Tours, Baby Setups, etc.
  - Each item has:
    - Description
    - Price per item or hour
    - “Request Now” button
    - Auto display of upcoming tasks (e.g. “Next clean is on July 6”)

• **Price Management**:
  - Admin can set default price per service in global settings.
  - Property Managers can override prices per villa.
  - Services can be:
    - Prepriced
    - Marked as “Ask Manager for Quote”

• **Internal Booking Routing**:
  - Every booking request can be marked as:
    - Guest-paid
    - Owner-paid
    - Company-paid
    - Complimentary (but still logged for record)
  - Each route affects the correct balance log.

• **Manager View**:
  - Managers can create bookings from backend if guest asks by message.
  - Auto logs request into Guest Timeline and creates task in Staff Dashboard.

• **Invoicing & Logging**:
  - All booked add-ons appear in:
    - Guest billing logs
    - Owner monthly expense logs (if routed there)
    - Staff task module (e.g., massage at 3PM → task assigned)

• **Complimentary Logic**:
  - Admin or Manager can flag a service as:
    - Owner Gift
    - Company Gift
    - Still shown in logs (for cost analysis)
    - Still appears in staff tasks, just with zero charge.

• **Optional Auto-Sync**:
  - If massage or cleaning booked, create task instantly.
  - AI verifies if it’s already scheduled (e.g., during-stay clean already booked).

Benefits:
✔️ One-click guest bookings  
✔️ Track who pays what  
✔️ Create task automatically  
✔️ Prevents missed extras revenue  
✔️ Clear accountability and gift visibility
