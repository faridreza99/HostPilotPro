Task: Implement task-date filters and “Filter” button next to the search bar on Tasks page.

Goal: Add a UI filter button beside the existing search input that allows users to filter tasks by: Today, This week, Next 7 days, Next 30 days, Next 90 days, and Custom range. Ensure API supports due_from and due_to query params and returns tasks ordered by due_date ascending with null due_date last. Update frontend to send those params and show filtered, chronological results.

Files to update (frontend):

src/components/TasksBar.jsx (or the component that houses search) — add the Filter button and dropdown. You can use the provided TasksBar.jsx code snippet.

src/pages/tasks.jsx or src/pages/TasksPage.jsx — call API with due_from & due_to; sort tasks by due_date ascending; show filter label.

CSS/Tailwind: use existing classes or tailwind classes from snippet.

Files to update (backend) — implement in whichever backend is used (Node/Express or Laravel). Add support for these query params:

Endpoint: GET /api/tasks?q=&due_from=YYYY-MM-DD&due_to=YYYY-MM-DD&page=&per_page=

Behavior: if due_from and due_to provided, return only tasks with due_date between those dates (exclude null due_date). If not provided, return all tasks paginated. Always sort result by due_date ASC and push null due_date to the bottom.

Provide example query (SQL or ORM). See included SQL/Knex/Laravel examples.

Backend implementation hints:

Node/Express: add parsing of due_from/due_to in the controller; build a WHERE due_date BETWEEN clause; order by CASE WHEN due_date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END, due_date ASC.

Laravel: use whereBetween('due_date', [$from,$to]) and orderByRaw.

Test plan:

API: GET /api/tasks?due_from=2025-10-26&due_to=2025-10-26 should only return tasks whose due_date = 2025-10-26.

UI: Click “Next 30 days” — network request must include correct due_from & due_to.

Sorting: tasks rendered in ascending due_date; tasks with null due_date appear after dated tasks.

Acceptance criteria:

Filter button visible and usable beside search field.

Selecting a range queries backend and displays chronological tasks.

Clear filter option resets to unfiltered list.

Custom range opens date-picker (if available) or accept due_from/due_to passed from parent.

Commands to run locally (example):

Start frontend: npm run dev (or project-specific command).

Start backend: npm run dev or php artisan serve.

Run tests: npm test (or PHPUnit for Laravel).

Deliverable: commit branch feature/task-date-filter with PR that includes screenshots and Postman examples for the API query and UI network request.

If you need to change files but unsure which file is the “search bar” component — search for components rendering placeholder text "Search tasks by title, description, or property" and attach patch there.
