🔧 MAINTENANCE LOG & BACKLOG
- Visible to Admin, PM, Staff (property-linked), and Owners (for their villas)
- Shows:
  - Open maintenance issues
  - Resolved maintenance issues (with date/time, photos, comments)

⚠️ AI-DRIVEN FUTURE TASK SUGGESTIONS:
- Based on historical data, the system should auto-suggest recurring services:
  - “Next AC service due in 60 days (last was 10 May 2025)”
  - “No pest control in last 120 days – schedule alert”
  - Suggestions appear in Admin + PM dashboard and property overview
  - Button: “Create Task from Suggestion”

📋 UTILITIES TRACKING & BILL ALERTS:
- Sections per property for:
  - Electricity
  - Water
  - Internet
  - Pest control
  - (Custom: Admin can add custom utility titles like Gas, HOA Fee)
- Each utility:
  - Provider (dropdown or manually added)
  - Account number
  - Bill history (table: month, amount, receipt upload)
  - Bill due date tracking with smart reminders:
    - Example: Electricity usually arrives around 17th → if by 21st no receipt uploaded, send alert to PM/Admin
  - Currency configurable (THB default)

💡 PROPERTY INFO SIDEBAR
