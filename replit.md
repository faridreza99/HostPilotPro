## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**: User authenticates via Replit → Session created → Role determined → Route access granted
2. **Property Operations**: Frontend requests → Express middleware auth check → Database query via Drizzle → Response with filtered data based on role
3. **Task Management**: Create/update requests → Validation → Database persistence → Real-time UI updates via React Query
4. **Booking Process**: Form submission → Validation → Availability check → Database creation → Calendar refresh
