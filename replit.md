# HostPilotPro - Hospitality Management Platform

## Overview
HostPilotPro is a multi-tenant property management platform for hospitality professionals, offering organization isolation, role-based access, and comprehensive management features including property, task, booking, and financial oversight. It features an AI bot, "Captain Cortex," for intelligent assistance. The platform is designed for scalable, multi-tenant deployment with separate company domains, encrypted API key storage, and subscription-based licensing, aiming to be a leader in hospitality technology.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform uses Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for a modern, consistent design. It features a modular, hierarchical navigation system with role-based visibility, enhanced by visual indicators like role badges and color-coded access levels. The design prioritizes mobile responsiveness.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, TanStack React Query for state management, and Vite for building.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) for authentication, and `express-session` with PostgreSQL store for session management.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. All data tables include `organizationId` for tenant separation.
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with role-based authorization.
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Supports separate company domains, encrypted API key storage per organization, and tenant-aware database queries.
- **Performance Optimization**: Multi-layer caching (in-memory, React Query), fast API endpoints, and lazy loading ensure instant navigation.
- **Real-Time Data Updates**: Centralized query key management (`client/src/lib/queryKeys.ts`) ensures consistent cache invalidation across all modules, supporting global and property-specific views.
- **AI Integration**: Custom OpenAI Assistant (`asst_OATIDMTgutnkdOJpTrQ9Mf7u`) for the Captain Cortex AI bot with real-time database-grounded Q&A. Cache is disabled for live data accuracy.
