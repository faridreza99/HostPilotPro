# HostPilotPro - Hospitality Management Platform

## Overview
HostPilotPro is a comprehensive, multi-tenant property management platform designed for licensing to hospitality professionals. It offers complete organization isolation, role-based access control, property management, task tracking, booking systems, and financial oversight with source attribution. The platform includes an AI bot, "Captain Cortex AI bot," providing intelligent assistance. It is built for scalable multi-tenant deployment with separate company domains, encrypted API key storage, and subscription-based licensing, aiming for a significant presence in the hospitality tech market.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform utilizes Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui for a modern design system, styled with Tailwind CSS for consistent theming. A modular, hierarchical navigation system with role-based visibility ensures an intuitive user experience. Visual indicators like role badges, icons, and color-coded access levels enhance usability. Design prioritizes mobile responsiveness.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, TanStack React Query for state management, and Vite for building.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, Replit Auth for authentication (OpenID Connect), and express-session with PostgreSQL store for session management.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. All data tables include `organizationId` for tenant separation.
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with role-based authorization.
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Supports separate company domains, encrypted API key storage per organization, and tenant-aware database queries.
- **Performance Optimization**: Multi-layer caching (in-memory, React Query), fast API endpoints, and lazy loading for modules ensure instant navigation.
- **AI Integration**: Custom OpenAI Assistant (`asst_OATIDMTgutnkdOJpTrQ9Mf7u`) for the Captain Cortex AI bot, with intelligent fallback and response caching and a data-grounded Q&A system.
